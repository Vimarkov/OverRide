The program takes two args. The first arg asks for a number and the second asks for the index were to store the number.
Our index is submit to some operations that change its value at some point in the program.
There is a function called "store_number" that store the number into an address. This address is the result of operations
on our Index.
The issue with this program is that we can modify the address where is stored "Number" with the result of the calculation
of our "Index".
The idea to get a shell is to do a ret2libc exploit. In order to do this, we will modify the arg of the memset function with "sh",
then write on the GOT addres of memset the address of sysem funcion. And finally make the program restart by writting 
the main+6 address on the GOT of printf so that the command "system("sh")" will give us a shell with level08 permissions.


Because the program reserves 4 bytes storage every 8 bytes we need to modify the len of environements variables so that we can
modify the GOT of printtf and the GOT of memesett in the same execution.

$> export TESTEST=AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

What we need (Every time we store Number into the address pointed by Index):

1)
- Number: 0x68732F2F (1752379183) This is the future arg for system function. "//sh"
- Index : 1073742050 This is the index that correspond to $ebp+12, the fist element that is checked by memset

2)
$> (gdb) p systetm
0xF7E6AED0 (4159090384)
- Number: 4159090384 This is the address of system
- Index: 33632971 This the GOT address of the memset function

3)
- Number: 0x8048729 (134514473) This the address of main+6
- Index: 33632963 This the GOT address of the printf function
