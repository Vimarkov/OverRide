We can see that the program ask for a password. The password we submit to it will be 
subtracted to the value 0x1337d00d and pseudo randomize with rand/srand(time(NULL)). If the
result of the substraction is under 22 the rand function is not call.
The program do a xor operation with the string "Q}|u`sfg~sf{}|a3" and the value of our arg.
If the result string match with congratulation a shell is launch.
What we can do is brutforce the password until it match.
