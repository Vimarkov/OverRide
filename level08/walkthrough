The program take one argument that specify a file. The file is store in a file called backup.

$> cd /tmp
$> touch test ; echo "test" > test
$> ~/level08 test
ERROR: Failed to open ./backups/.log

The program read our file but does'nt find the backups file. So we create one that specify the file
we want to read.

$> cd /tmp
$> mkdir -p backups/home/users/level09
$> ~/level08  /home/users/level09/.pass
$> cat backups/home/users/level09/.pass
